			<div id="me-text">
				Hello! Welcome to my newly re-designed website.<br /><br />
				A number of sections have been redone or collapsed together, but regardless, I hope you enjoy your stay.
				Do let me know if you see any issues with the webiste, and I'll fix it as soon as I can.
				<br /><br />
				So who am I?
				<br /><br />
				My name is Mina Li. I am a third-year Computer Science major in Unversity of California, and am planning on graduating May 2015.
				Time passed a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would, and now I'm looking for a full-time position starting in summer.
				<br /><br />
				Primarily, I'm interested in doing work that is personally and socially meaningful. I think technology has a great capabilities for changing 
				the way society operates and I want to see it change for the better around me. 
				<br /><br />
				That being said, I still don't know exactly what I want to do, but I'm open-minded and like to try new things, so 
				I'll probably keep trying out whatever opportunities come my way until I figure it out.
